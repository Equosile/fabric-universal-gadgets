<pre>
  * Project Theme

    This project (ofaafo) has been aiming at
multiverse features including many mini games and
convenient utilities.

    That being said, since this is under early stages,
there are many omissions not fully implemented yet.

    Hopefully, there would be gradual ameliorations.

* CONVERSION (1.0.2 -> 1.0.3 BACKPORT)
  - It is now backported from 1.20.2 to 1.20.1.
  - Previously, 1.20.2 Fabric 0.14.23 API 0.90.4
  - Now, 1.20.1 Fabric 0.15.9 API 0.92.1
  - However, the 1.20.2 version is still being distributed as a beta testing.
<pre>
    Many big projects like Create Fabric have been maintained as 1.20.1.
    This mod (OFAAFO) may pursue a convenient compatibility with those projects.
    Therefore, the backport is fulfilled at this rate.
</pre>
* HOTFIX (1.0.1 -> 1.0.2 UPDATE)
  - The Block States of Dice Blocks become much stable due to this hotfix.
* NEW FEATURES (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1 UPDATE)
  - Independent Internal Timer aside from the existing Server Tick Event Handler
  - Dice Rolling becomes much stable.
  - Dice Blocks have periodic Redstone signals.
